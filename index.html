                    the last time i held you 120 pounds, i mean bones <br>
                    find you in the garage alone <br>
                    find five minutes for me on the phone <br>
                    between corona and patr&oacute;n <br>
                    you teach me how to hold a ghost <br>
                    teach me how to protect my voice because you couldn't protect your own<br>
                    teach me the violence of silence becoming grief's clean home <br>
                    caregiver as in we are never alone<br>
                    caregiver as in i carry it through my bloodstream<br>
                    i carry it in my bones<br>
                    caregiver as in you didn't have to be my blood <br>
                    you could have been someone i didn't even know<br>
                    caregiver as in your breath is my breath <br>
                    and that is something no state will ever own<br>
                    caregiver as in i need your breath<br>
                    i need your trust, your touch, your love<br>
                    because that is the only way for us to grow, to be free<br>

                welcome to openly, an album I made in 2023 about the spirals between grief and growth, loss and emergence, dreams and memories. these spiral have always been paths of returning to myself.

                making this album has been a release ritual, a slow practice of letting go. I wrote these poems in moments over the past 4 years that I could find stillness inside motion - in my sleep, in parked cars, in line at the post office, waiting for the bus, sitting next to the Pacific Ocean.

                    sunbeams<br/>
                    lists of things you love<br/> 
                    mini skirts and speaking matter of factly<br/>
                    my words are a loveless breed torn between<br/>
                    my clumsy low pitch and your mumbly accent<br/>
                    in fact<br/>
                    my voice is a remnant of everyone i've ever loved<br/>
                    and i hope i never stop sounding like you<br/>
                    never stop speaking in long, clear sentences<br/>
                    speaking til my words drip and crumble and fray at the ends<br/>
                    thats how you sound with my chin on your stomach<br/>
                    thats how you sound when you talk about home<br/>
                    when you have so much to say but dont<br/>
                    my dreams are speckled pink, 
                    menial things that actually happened<br/>
                    you walked me to the bus stop<br/>
                    you invited me to your grandmother's house<br/>
                    then avoided me for 3 months<br/>
                    you prayed for me and I didn't understand why<br/>
                    i laid in the grass field outside<br/>
                    the church on Sunday morning<br/>
                    i'd happily make Sunday mornings my eternity<br/>
                    spent counting people on their balconies<br/>
                    the sun pouring into my eyes<br/>
                    waiting for you<br/>

                   to let go of the places and people who could not hold me is to return to myself. to remember that the only forever is inside me. and that i am grateful for every drip of life in this body. that i will always hold this body. that i will always use this body to love openly.to care for and listen and see the worlds around me and allow all the beauty in those worlds to rebound back through me. that i will never stop trusting in my ability to love. that i can never close myself beyond reopening. that i have seen over and over that what is lost can be found again. to return to this body is to remember the ways i have held myself through loneliness, through violence, through confusion and to see that i can and will never be empty so long as i protect my hope, my curiosity, my wonder, my joy, my openess to all these things - things that are as infinite in the world as they are inside me.
