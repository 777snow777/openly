                welcome to openly, an album I made in 2023 about the spirals between grief and growth, loss and emergence, dreams and memories. these spiral have always been paths of returning to myself.

                making this album has been a release ritual, a slow practice of letting go. I wrote these poems in moments over the past 4 years that I could find stillness inside motion - in my sleep, in parked cars, in line at the post office, waiting for the bus, sitting next to the Pacific Ocean.

               this is a dream i had a few days ago if someone wants to interpret it, you can email me @ 77snows@gmail.com:<br> i couldn't see anything but grey - some green and black dots. To one side of my body, I heard a lot of movement and many different voices and to the other side of my body, there was stillness and silence. i felt this very strong wind that would come and go every time this group of girls rollerskated back and forth past me. the wind was so strong it shook my entire body, but besides this, I couldnt feel anything. like i was free falling. and i only felt my body when the wind came back. when the girls skated by, i could hear them whispering and laughing and recognized their voices. there were different girls every time, but some stayed the same.

                    you invited me to your grandmother's house<br/>
                    then avoided me for 3 months<br/>
                    you prayed for me and I didn't understand why<br/>
                    i laid in the grass field outside<br/>
                    the church on Sunday morning<br/>
                    i'd happily make Sunday mornings my eternity<br/>
                    spent counting people on their balconies<br/>
                    the sun pouring into my eyes<br/>

                        <p>that one day i'd want to undo what's been done</p>
                        <p>but this spiral is an opening</p>
                        <p>this spiral is forever unfolding</p>

                    i made this song thinking about how i am always wanting to hold someone and be held by someone. after i made this song, i realized this is actually  how i cope with grief, especially grief around the endings of relationships. because to be inside the light is to always get to be close to another.

                   to let go of the places and people who could not hold me is to return to myself. to remember that the only forever is inside me. and that i am grateful for every drip of life in this body. that i will always hold this body. that i will always use this body to love openly.to care for and listen and see the worlds around me and allow all the beauty in those worlds to rebound back through me. that i will never stop trusting in my ability to love. that i can never close myself beyond reopening. that i have seen over and over that what is lost can be found again. to return to this body is to remember the ways i have held myself through loneliness, through violence, through confusion and to see that i can and will never be empty so long as i protect my hope, my curiosity, my wonder, my joy, my openess to all these things - things that are as infinite in the world as they are inside me.
