               to let go of the places and people who could not hold me is to return to myself. to remember that the only forever is inside me. and that i am grateful for every drip of life in this body. that i will always hold this body. that i will always use this body to love openly.to care for and listen and see the worlds around me and allow all the beauty in those worlds to rebound back through me. that i will never stop trusting in my ability to love. that i can never close myself beyond reopening. that i have seen over and over that what is lost can be found again. to return to this body is to remember the ways i have held myself through loneliness, through violence, through confusion and to see that i can and will never be empty so long as i protect my hope, my curiosity, my wonder, my joy, my openess to all these things - things that are as infinite in the world as they are inside me.
