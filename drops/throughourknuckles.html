        <p>i don't want to age<br/>i wan't to build a cave<br/>in your chest<br/>make a sunset from your every breath<br/>make time be the beat of your heart<br/>this world can be still<br/>every frequency looping infinitely<br/>through our knuckles</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>you are the wind<br/>and i asked you for stillness<br/>in turn you returned the ocean floor<br/>upturned places i have slowly mourned<br/>as they broke down in side me<br/>became soil for this body<br/>you upturned places i don't even remember<br/>places that live like a whisper broken between my ears<br/>you are the wind<br/>i am the mountains<br/>and you are the wind<br/>I inhaled and exhaled<br/>and asked you to just listen to my breath as i do to yours<br/>tell me, what are you reaching for<br/>you are the wind<br/>you come back<br/>you continue to come back for more<br/>you bring the currents that eat the shores</p>
