            <p>the hum of pop songs twisting through now empty streets<br>hanging between car windows and bird whistles<br>my love is through the wind, caught in your teeth<br>fermented with months i spend longing<br>find it years later buried<br>in the weeds, cracking through the concrete<br>next to the roots of the tall trees<br>marked with a letter in bold black ink<br>painfully obvious, but more painfully protected<br>my love is the water for my reflection<br>rippling with the times i have forgiven<br>but it is so still and clear in your presence<br></p>
