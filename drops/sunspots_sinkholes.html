                my dreams feel like<br/>
                patches of dirt <br/>
                outside the church<br/>
                the metal bench <br/>
                next to the river<br/>
                playing backwards<br/>
                picture by picture<br/>
                letter by letter<br/>
            </p>
            <div id="sunspot1">
                my dreams come like sunspots<br/>
                blood clots<br/>
                my dreams are speckled pink<br/> 
                sunbeams<br/>
                lists of things you love<br/> 
                mini skirts and speaking matter of factly<br/>
                my words are a loveless breed torn between<br/>
                my clumsy low pitch and your mumbly accent<br/>
                in fact<br/>
                my voice is a remnant of everyone i've ever loved<br/>
                and i hope i never stop sounding like you<br/>
                never stop speaking in long, clear sentences<br/>
                speaking til my words drip and crumble and fray at the ends<br/>
                thats how you sound with my chin on your stomach<br/>
                thats how you sound when you talk about home<br/>
                when you have so much to say but dont<br/>
                my dreams are speckled pink, 
                menial things that actually happened<br/>
                you walked me to the bus stop<br/>
                you invited me to your grandmother's house<br/>
                then avoided me for 3 months<br/>
                you prayed for me and I didn't understand why<br/>
                i laid in the grass field outside<br/>
                the church on Sunday morning<br/>
                i'd happily make Sunday mornings my eternity<br/>
                spent counting people on their balconies<br/>
                the sun pouring into my eyes<br/>
                waiting for you<br/>
